Analysis of benchmarks
======================

As soon as the benchmarks have been submitted you can request a summary of the
current performance. If a job has not yet finished, not yet started or crashed,
MDBenchmark notifies you and marks the affected benchmarks accordingly.

Retrieving the results
----------------------

The benchmark results can be retrieved immediately after they have been
submitted, even if the jobs have not yet started. To do this, simply run::

  mdbenchmark analyze

This will print a summary of your benchmarks. You can do this any time
and check the status of your simulations even if they haven't completed yet.
The printed results look like this::

  +--------------------------+---------+----------+------------------+-------+--------+----------+
  | module                   |   nodes |   ns/day |   run time [min] | gpu   | host   |   ncores |
  |--------------------------+---------+----------+------------------+-------+--------+----------|
  | gromacs/2018.3           |       1 |   99.102 |               15 | True  | draco  |       24 |
  | gromacs/2018.3           |       2 |  161.454 |               15 | True  | draco  |       48 |
  | gromacs/2018.3           |       3 |        ? |               15 | True  | draco  |       72 |
  | gromacs/2018.3           |       4 |  181.614 |               15 | True  | draco  |       96 |
  +--------------------------+---------+----------+------------------+-------+--------+----------+

The results above showcases that MDBenchmark displays jobs that have not
finished, started or crashed with a question mark (``?``).

Saving a CSV file
-----------------

Once your runs have completed you can write an output CSV file for further processing and
plotting.
You can define the name of the output CSV file with the ``-s`` or ``--save-csv`` option::

  mdbenchmark analyze --save-csv my_benchmark_results.csv

Narrow down results to a specific benchmark
-------------------------------------------

Similar to the submission of benchmarks, you can use the ``--directory`` option
to narrow down the performance analysis to a specific path of benchmarks or a
single benchmark::

  mdbenchmark analyze --directory draco_gromacs/2018.3

Plot the number of cores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize the top of your plot with the ``--ncores`` option. It accepts
an integer value, referring to the number of cores per node. If the option is
not given, MDBenchmark will try to read this information from the log file.
